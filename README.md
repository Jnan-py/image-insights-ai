# Image Insights AI

**Image Insights AI** is an advanced Streamlit web application that leverages Google’s Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze images and generate insightful content. The app offers several features including audience analysis, content summarization, roadmap generation, similar content suggestions, interactive object detection (bounding boxes or point detection), and a conversational chat assistant—all tailored to the image’s context and intended audience.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Processing:**

  - Upload an image file or paste an image URL.
  - Save uploaded images locally in a secure folder.

- **Audience & Image Classification:**
  - Analyze the image to determine its classification (e.g., Educational or Entertainment) and generate a list of related audience options.
- **Content Generation:**

  - **Summary:** Generate a detailed summary of the image content.
  - **Roadmap (for Educational images):** Get a learning roadmap related to the image topic.
  - **Similar Content (for General/Entertainment images):** Retrieve information about similar images or related topics.
  - **Chat:** Engage in a conversational Q&A with an AI-powered assistant that uses the image context and selected audience to provide expert insights.

- **Object Detection:**

  - Perform object detection using two modes:
    - **Square (2D Bounding Boxes):** Get bounding boxes around detected objects.
    - **Point (1D):** Get key point detections with labels.

- **Interactive Interface:**
  - Intuitive sidebar navigation with an option menu.
  - Dynamic chat interface that maintains conversation history.
  - Visualizations of detection results overlayed on the image.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jnan-py/image-insights-ai.git
   cd image-insights-ai
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Upload or Provide an Image URL:**

   - Use the sidebar to choose between file upload or pasting an image link.
   - Once an image is loaded, the app processes it to extract audience and classification details.

3. **Select Audience & Mode:**

   - Choose an audience from the options generated by the app.
   - Depending on the image classification, select from the horizontal menu:
     - **Summary**
     - **Roadmap** (if Educational)
     - **Similar Content** (if Entertainment)
     - **Chat**
     - **Object Detection**

4. **Interact with the App:**
   - Generate a summary, roadmap, or similar content.
   - Engage with the AI chat assistant.
   - Perform object detection on the image and view results with bounding boxes or key points.
